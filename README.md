ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ramalmar, an Electronic Engineer with a Master's degree in AI

ðŸŽ“ I graduated with a Master's degree AI from Universidad de Valencia in 2023.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I work as a freelance Electronic Prototype Designer and specialize in designing and programming microcontrollers and FPGAs.

ðŸ’¡ Check out my projects: [IA-porfolio](https://github.com/ramalmar/Artificial-Inteligence-Portfolio)

ðŸŒ± I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in AI programming and I'm excited to apply my knowledge and skills to develop cutting-edge AI systems.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm always looking to collaborate with other engineers and developers on exciting projects related to electronics, embedded systems, and AI programming.

ðŸ¤” I'm also interested in learning more about advanced AI programming concepts such as neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing.

ðŸ’» Additionally, I have experience in the creation of custom electronics systems for the acquisition of electro-physiological signals.
